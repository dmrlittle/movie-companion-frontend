# Movie Companion Frontend

This repository hosts the **React and TypeScript single-page application (SPA)** for the Movie Companion project. The initial application structure was **generated by Lovable**, and then further developed and modified to meet specific project requirements, providing a user interface for AI-powered movie recommendations and bookmark management.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (LTS recommended)
* npm or Yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone repo:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-companion-frontend.git` & `cd movie-companion-frontend`
2.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
3.  **Configure API URL:** Ensure `API_BASE_URL` in `src/context/AuthContext.tsx` (and other API call locations) matches your backend's URL (default: `http://localhost:8000/api`).

### Running the Application

```bash
npm start
```
Starts the development server (usually at http://localhost:3000) with hot-reloading.
Building for Production
Bash


```bash
npm run build
```
Creates an optimized build directory with static files, ready to be served.

## Architectural Choices
* **React & TypeScript:** Component-based UI with strong type-checking for robust and scalable development.
* **Lovable Generated Base:** Utilized an AI code generator for initial setup, accelerating development.
* **Axios:** Simple, promise-based HTTP client for API interactions.
* **React Context API:** Centralized state management for user authentication (JWT token, login status).
* **Separate Repository:** Decouples frontend development and deployment from the backend.

## Trade-offs

* **Initial Setup Complexity:** SPAs like React apps can have a steeper initial setup and learning curve compared to traditional web pages.
* **Client-Side Security:** Storing JWTs directly in localStorage (a common practice) introduces vulnerability to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
